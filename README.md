SpeechControlledTimer
=====================

Simple timer/stopwatch which can controlled by your voice

# Disclaimer
As I'm writing this document I realized that SpeechControlled**StopWatch** were the better name, however I'm to lazy to rename all. Please bear with me.

# What are the features?
* Counting the time
* Can be started, stopped and paused
  * counting the current break and aggregate all breaks to total break time
* Can be controlled by simple speech commands or buttons  

# When do I need the tool?
Well there can be a lot of scenario where the tool is useful. The main reason why the tool was build is the following:

Imagine you where doing some sports in-door and watching some movies (dvds/bluerays) or listen to music/audio-books. 
There are some kinds of sport which are applicable in-door for example:

* riding bicycle
* running on treadmill
* using cross trainer
* yoga
* and so on

You can see improvements of your training by tracking your fitness action. Therefore you need at least some basic information like:  

* How long I'm already doing sport?
* How long is the actual break?
* How long the breaks all together?

There are a couple of way's to track such simple data e.g. smart-phones, fitness tracker, (smart-)watches, different software products. But there are either *too expensive*, *too hard to use* or *far too complex*. 
The SpeechControlledTimer is easy and provide you the requested information, later you need maybe more data like heart rate, distance etc. Than of course you have to switch to some alternative mentioned above. But when starting with the training this tool is sufficient.

# How do I use the tool?
One the one hand there are three buttons:

* **Start** - start the counting of trainings time 
* **Stop** - stop the counting of all times
* **Pause/Weiter** 
  * Pause - break the counting of trainings time and start counting of break time 
  * Weiter - resume counting of trainings time again and stop counting of break time
	* maybe later I will localize the tool than *Pause* is called *Break* and *Weiter* is called *Resume* in English GUI
 
And on the other hand ... well it is called **Speech**ControlledTimer which mean it can controlled by your voice. Possible commands are (description please see above):

* **Start**
* **Stop**
* **Pause**
* **Break**
* **Weiter**
* **Resume**
